## About

This app is designed to facilitate open and honest communication in relationships. 

You and your partner can link to each other with a unique link code, then set and update in realtime your ratings for different aspects of the relationship, e.g. Verbal Affection, Physical Affection. 

This can then open a conversation about why you each feel that way, moving the focus from your phones to each other.

> App is not yet released, but is being prepared for a Google Play Store release.
>
> Currently focusing on Android development. A web app is also being considered, but iOS is unlikely due to the Apple developer costs.
