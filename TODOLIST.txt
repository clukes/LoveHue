TODO:
Bugs:
/ Partner name doesn't update instantly on partner's bars page.

? Fix status bar not showing up
- When signing out then signing back in, there is a gap between appbar title and subtitle.

For 1.0 Release:
? When pulling partners bars from online database, check if still linked to partner. If not, delete partner id from local storage.
- Put your bar numbers on partners bars screen (next to their numbers somewhere) for easy comparison.
  [NOTE: Possibly not needed anymore now that scroll position persists when switching screens.
   Maybe put previous bar values on bars screen? At least until history is added.]

- Add email sign in button to convert account when anonymously signed in. - Hoping flutterfire ui does this soon. If not will have to implement myself.

- Delete account on anonymous sign out?

- Add feedback form to settings page. Have options for bug report, feature request and other.
